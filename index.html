            <p class="paragraph">You may think that only the most charismatic individuals can lead a cause for change. That you must have a strong knowledge of people, your issue, and a surging sense of passion to fight for what you believe is right. While we do see rebellions all around the world lead by strong courageous figures, there are countless more silent rebellions fighting against what they believe is wrong in their communities without the world knowing. And these silent superheroes are what carry our modern society.</p>
            <p class="paragraph"> This digital essay will discuss the enduring need for silent rebellions, what they are, and how they are presented in texts such as <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/To-Kill-a-Mockingbird"><i>“To Kill a Mockingbird” [TKAM] </i></a>by Harper Lee & <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/12-Angry-Men"><i>“12 Angry Men” [12AM]</i></a> by Reginald Rose, along with how they present the fight against </p>

            <p class="paragraph">When have you <i>actually</i> showed empathy in your life?</p>
            <p class="paragraph">We are taught all throughout our lives to “show empathy” to others around us. We know that we should understand how others are feeling & use that to make changes to how we act that person. But this is just a way of modifying decisions to not upset someone. Now, have you actually fought to defend someone going through a hard time? </p>
            <p class="paragraph">In TKAM, we are introduced to Maycomb. Set in 1930’s Alabama, it is an in-depth depiction of the classic prejudice town. Throughout the book we see Atticus, a passionate lawyer who is defending an African-American man accused of sexually assaulting a white woman. Note that in this time, there would be an all-white jury consisting of racially biased individuals defending this white girl.</p>
            <blockquote class="quote">"You never really understand a person until you consider things from his point of view... until you climb into his skin & walk around in it" - Atticus Finch</blockquote>

            <p class="paragraph"> In 12AM, we are introduced to a 15-year-old boy who inhabits the slums, and is falsely accused of murdering his father. We are shown two witnesses who make up stories to get the boy accused, and a jury full of men who rush the case to get home. This creates a highly dismissive & bias environment. So, who’s leading the silent rebellion here?</p>
            <p class="paragraph">If you’ve read the book, you’d know that Juror #8 was the lead for change. He questioned all of the ‘facts’ other Jurors brought up and laid pure logic in his arguments. However, despite his best efforts, one man didn’t have the power to influence 11 others. One other man had to step up & face the intense peer pressure.</p>
            <blockquote class="quote">"Thank you. (to the 7th juror) This gentleman- (he indicates to the 8th juror) has been standing alone against us... it's not easy to stand alone against the ridicule of others. He gambled for support and I gave it to him... The boy on trial is probably guilty. But I want to hear more" - 9th Juror</blockquote>
            <p class="paragraph">At one point, all the other jurors had delved into their own biases & not considered the purely logical side of the argument, the only one that matters. Juror #8 was providing facts while Jurors 3 & 7 were ignoring them, but by rebelling against the peer pressure, Juror #9 fuelled the silent rebellion that eventually let the truth come out & win the case by providing an empathetical side to Juror #8’s logical argument. This is the power that empathy has in leading silent rebellions, and this goes to show exactly why we need an enduring rebel voice, now matter how quiet it is.</p>
